Business Proposal Note

##  Purpose of this Document
This document is provided to ensure that the software we develop will be consistent with the
needs of our client. It is a short description of the project requirements that we have been
provided with. Stating these requirements explicitly helps ensure that any potential
miscommunications are dealt with at an early stage when the cost of implementing changes is
still low. This document presents a general description of the software that we are working on.
Finally, there will be a summary of the project. This will help us ensure that our end product
fully meets their needs. This document will also be a useful resource for those who will be
upgrading or maintaining the software after it has been completed.
